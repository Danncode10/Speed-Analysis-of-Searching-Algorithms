# 🔍 Search Algorithm Benchmark

This Jupyter Notebook compares the execution time of 10 different search algorithms to analyze their efficiency.

## 📌 Algorithms Tested
- **Linear Search**
- **Binary Search**
- **Jump Search**
- **Interpolation Search**
- **Exponential Search**
- **Fibonacci Search**
- **Ternary Search**
- **Hashing-based Search**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

## 📊 Project Overview
- Generates a dataset of **100 random numbers**.
- Implements and times each search algorithm.
- Stores execution times in a structured format using **pandas**.
- Visualizes results using **matplotlib**.

## 🚀 Key Findings
- **Exponential Search** was the fastest.
- **Hashing-based Search** was the slowest due to hash table overhead.
- **Binary, Jump, and Interpolation searches** performed efficiently for sorted data.

## 📦 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
